		"From day one, we've asked ourselves: 'Does this actually help people?' This question gets us through tough calls and shapes who we are. We're playing the long game here.",
		"We think about how our work affects real people's lives. We build tech that brings people together, keeps your information safe, and treats everyone fairly. When we stick to these basics, good things happen."
