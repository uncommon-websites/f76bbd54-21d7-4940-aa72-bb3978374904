    "prompt": "A restaurant owner stands in the middle of a bustling kitchen, surrounded by staff in motion and stacks of supplies. The owner is captured mid-action, confidently overseeing operations, not looking at the camera. The environment is authentic, with real equipment, handwritten notes, and worn surfaces visible. Natural daylight streams through windows, creating high-contrast lighting that highlights the owner's calm demeanor amid the busy scene. The color palette is slightly desaturated with natural blues subtly accenting uniforms or kitchen items, balanced by warm wood and metal textures. The composition uses layered depth, placing the owner in the middle ground with operational activity in the foreground and background, incorporating motion blur to emphasize the owner's steady presence. The overall mood conveys quiet confidence and control within a complex, lived-in workspace.",
