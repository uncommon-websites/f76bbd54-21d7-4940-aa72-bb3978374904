    "description": "The image depicts an optical illusion featuring two interconnected cubes. The cubes are outlined in black with white faces, and they are positioned diagonally, connected at one corner. The design creates a visual paradox where the cubes appear to be linked in an impossible way, defying the rules of three-dimensional geometry. The overall shape resembles a figure-eight or an infinity symbol formed by the two cubes. The background is transparent, emphasizing the stark contrast between the black outlines and white faces of the cubes."
